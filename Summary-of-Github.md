Some summary of important parts that we covered about Github is that this is a great website where many programmers are able to work on a certain project together using this source. Each programmer can take a different branch, besides the master branch, and edit the way he/she would make changes. After a pull request is sent, all the other programmers can check whether the correction was sufficient enough to be edited on the actual master branch and discuss together: this shows how Github is a great tool to collaborate with other programmers.
